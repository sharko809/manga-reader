# manga-reader
One of my first android attempts :)

Once I found myself traveling pretty much. During long trips I like reading manga. But here's a problem - my bad mobile internet. 
So I decided to write something convinient for offline manga reading. Just having you pictures or archive with pictures should be enough.
And this idea brought birth to this app. Though it's still very raw it helped me a lot of times :)
